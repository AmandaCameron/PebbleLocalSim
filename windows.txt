[THE WINDOWS SDK IS NOT READY YET]

[Installation]
You can use the the directory .\build\windows\ as a windows sdk but if you like to have it
somewhere else (probably easier to access) you can follow these instructions:
1. Switch to your chosen directory and type <original_sdk>/build/windows/install.bat
2. This projects requires MinGW. You have to set the bin path of it in the 
   <sdk>/envvars.bat file or you can leave it at default and extract the archives
   listed below into the folder <sdk>\MinGW\
Note: If you do these changes before you use install.bat your installed sdk will have your
changes too.

[Use]
Unlike on other operating systems, the pebble team has no sdk for windows yet, that is why
you have to create a project with a tool provided by this sdk. To create a project switch 
to the directory you want your projects folder in and run the command:
	create.project.bat <project_name>
This will create a sample project for you to start coding. To build your project run:
	.\tools\build.local.bat
from your projects main folder. To run it you can switch to the directory <project>\build\
local\ or you can run:
	.\tools\run.local.bat
also from your projects main folder.

[Build the project on your own]
To build an installation of this pebble simulator sdk switch to the directory .\build\windows.
There you have two commands:
	build.library.bat to build the library used to create the simulator
	build.resCompiler.bat to build the resource compiler
Note that you need MinGW (see [Installation]) to build this project
